# datafun-05-sql_1
## 1. To create project and clone to machine
I created a new repository on Github: datafun-05-sql_1
I clicked README.md to write little notes about this project. 
I then went to my file explorer of my computer and clicked a folder to connect the file and then I opened the terminal for that file.
I cloned the repository to that folder using the following command:

# git clone site_URL

## 2. To create Virtual Environment for the project
I open new terminal on VS code and use the following command to create a virtual environment. 

# py -m venv .venv
# .venv\Scripts\Activate

## 3. To add data folder and .csv
I added manually a data folder to the project folder, then added two .csv files in VS Code.

## To create the db_format.py file
When executed, it creates format.db and runs a script that calls the create_tables.sql to fill the database. 

## To create the db_operations.py file
Here, I created tables and insert values in the table, update, delete, remove data from the table.
